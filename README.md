# About

D3MetafeatureExtraction wraps the BYU-DML metalearn.metafeatures module to fit within the D3M
context and use the D3M dependencies.
This is a TA1 primitive which computes dataset metafeatures.
These metafeatures are used to aid in TA2 pipeline construction decisions and should (probably) not
be used directly in a TA2 pipeline.
